/*
 * The functions `draw_horizontal_line` and `draw_vertical_line` implement
 * Bresenham's line-drawing algorithm, a widely-used method for rendering
 * straight lines on a grid (like a pixel-based image). The principle is based
 * on using a decision parameter (`p`) to determine the best approximation of
 * the true geometric line, avoiding floating-point calculations for efficiency.
 *
 * 1. `draw_horizontal_line`: This function handles lines where the slope
 *    (|dy/dx|) is less than or equal to 1, meaning the primary direction
 *    of movement is along the x-axis. For each step along x, the function
 *    uses the decision parameter (`p`) to determine whether to adjust the y
 *    coordinate, ensuring the line stays close to its true path.
 *
 * 2. `draw_vertical_line`: This function deals with lines where the slope
 *    (|dy/dx|) is greater than 1, meaning the primary direction of movement
 *    is along the y-axis. Similarly, for each step along y, the decision
 *    parameter determines if the x coordinate needs to be adjusted to
 *    approximate the geometric line accurately.
 *
 * Both functions use integer arithmetic, making the algorithm efficient
 * and suitable for systems with limited computational power. The decision
 * parameter ensures pixel-perfect accuracy by balancing horizontal and
 * vertical steps, depending on the line's direction and steepness.

/*
 * The `calculate_line_steps` function computes the necessary steps for
 * drawing a line between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) using Bresenham's 
 * line-drawing algorithm. It calculates the absolute differences between 
 * the x and y coordinates (dx and dy), and it computes the decision parameter 
 * `p`, which will be used to determine whether the next pixel should 
 * be placed horizontally or vertically. The formula for the decision parameter 
 * is: p = 2 * dy - dx, which is essential for making the decision at each step.
 * This step ensures that we can choose the best pixel to draw to approximate 
 * the straight line. The result of the function is stored in the pointers 
 * passed as arguments for dx, dy, and p, which are then used in the drawing 
 * functions.
 *
 * The `draw_line` function is responsible for using the steps calculated 
 * by `calculate_line_steps` to draw the line on the image. It checks whether 
 * the line is more horizontal or vertical by comparing the differences between
 * dx and dy. If dx is greater than dy, the line has a shallow slope (horizontal),
 * and the `draw_horizontal_line` function is used. If dy is greater than dx,
 * the line has a steep slope (vertical), and the `draw_vertical_line` function is used.
 * The decision parameter `p` guides whether to move horizontally or vertically 
 * at each step, ensuring the line is drawn with minimal error, maintaining 
 * accuracy in pixel placement.
